This third test is designed to exercise the blank line tag.  This
first paragraph should be separated from the next one by a
single blank line.
:B 1 :P
This paragraph should be separated from the last one by a single
blank line, and its indent should be correct (usual five spaces).
:P :B 2
This paragraph should be separarated by two blank lines from the
     one before it,
  and should have the usual five-space indent.  It might be a
  bit harder to get right because the blank
  tag comes after the paragraph.  There are two kinds of problems
     this could cause: You might manage to generate an extra
     blank line if both tags try to finish the previous line.  It
must be finished
exactly once.  Or you might fumble the indent if you have
   the paragraph tag actually print the spaces, or if the blank
tag makes you forget about the indent.  Or you might miss the
      blank tag entirely if you implement the indent by adding
      space to the front of the new word.  (This can work, but
      you have to check things in the right order.)
:B 0
This should begin at the left, with no blank line.
:P Now, that was fun, wasn't it.  :B 8 No?  Well, just gotta
get your nerd on.
