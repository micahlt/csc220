 This
is the second test input.  It simply tests the operation of the
    the paragraph tag by providing several paragraphs.  :P
Each time the paragraph tag appears, your
       program should complete the current line.
     That means to issue a newline, but only if there are
   already
   some words        on the line.    The paragraph marker should never generate a blank line.  If it does, you are probably issuing
   a newline when you should suppress it.
:P
This is a short paragraph.

Here is another paragraph.  The previous one should be
  fill one line, exactly 75
characters wide
including the indent, and there should be no blank line
after it. None at all.  Not even a little one. :P
