:W 50
Now we will test changes in the width.  This very first paragraph
should be narrower than usual.  That's because I used a
tag to set the width.  Isn't that fun?
:W 35 :P
This one is more narrow still, and also the start of a
paragraph.  Of course, width can be changed apart from :W 70 starting
a paragraph, sort of like this.  The width change should create
   a line break without
   any blank line.  That rule is mostly to simplify
  interaction between width changes and the
      line break logic.  Kind of odd to change the width mid-flow, really.
:W 55 :B 2
Of course, it can make more sense along with a blank line.  You
should see two of them above here, and the lines are shorter now.
I will blather on a bit, so there are more words to fill in
this paragraph.  Then I will once again change the width again so
the text is narrower.
:P   :W 30
This is not a very wide paragraph.  So it should
generate a bunch of lines.
Well, okay.  Maybe it's a small bunch.
This is a paragraph and should be indented as usual.
