Now, I am going to try to break the program, by putting in
some odd stuff.
:P :P
N
\:P is not a paragraph marker. \This is not, either.  Nor is \\this.
:W 5
There is an instruction to \ keep the
width
at least 20.
Did you follow it?  Whataboutawordwhichistoolong anyway?
:W 30
Can you handle it? :B -7
       And, did you make sure not drop the negative blank line
count ball?

:B 2 :P :B 3
Did you get five and an indent?  Did 'ya?
:B 0 :B 0 :B 0
Just a break, but no blank lines.
:P :B 0 :B 1 :B 0
Exactly one blank line now, and an indent.
